## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB installed and running
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/getanjali-chawl/lms-auth-simple.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the `frontend` folder:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install the frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder:**

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
   ```

   This configuration assumes your backend will run on `http://localhost:4000`.

5. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React development server will start, and your frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Open a new terminal window, navigate to the project root, and then enter the `backend` folder:**

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

7. **Install the backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

8. **Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:**

   ```env
   PORT=4000
   MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
   ```

   Replace `<your_mongodb_uri>` with your MongoDB connection URI.

9. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will run on `http://localhost:4000`.

10. **Your LMS Authentication System is now up and running with the frontend and backend servers.**

## Usage

- You can access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and interact with the backend API at `http://localhost:4000`.
- Customize the frontend and backend code according to your project requirements.

## Folder Structure

- `frontend/` - Contains the React.js frontend code.
- `backend/` - Contains the Node.js and Express.js backend code.
